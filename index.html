          <h6>WINDOWSHOP is a cabinet of curiosities quite like no other, thousands of objects hand-picked from local junk stores, homes, and shops form a peculiar collection of tailor-made and titled keepsakes, with each title setting the stage for the objects at hand. From merry-go-rounds to marble cases, the works constitute a visual litany of funny, irreverent and at times, painfully honest observations about people and objects in relationship to time, place, memory, truth and love.</h6>
          <h6>By symbolically translating the collector’s control of the world through miniature reproductions, WINDOWSHOP takes a look at the psychological, cultural and aesthetic value of “things,” and the visual language that the latter forms. Like the cabinets of curiosities from Renaissance Europe, WINDOWSHOP serves as a personal memory theatre in the context of Singapore’s own Golden Age. Yet unlike the cabinet of curiosities of yore which tended toward a pompous collection of art and antiquities, WINDOWSHOP seeks to curate and celebrate the infinitely everyday and beautifully ordinary of our times.</h6>

          <p>TROPHY WALL is a glass cabinet constructed to house a collection of 16 custom-made and hand-painted trophies. The work celebrates 16 unsung heroes of Singaporean school days, pertaining to specific individuals whose talents weren’t recognized by the local education system, but who were champions in their own right. Physical Education wryly satirizes the rigid concept of merit in Singaporean schools, and pays overdue tribute to all the fantastic square pegs in our canonized round holes.</p>
